            I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
Then there's a pair of us!<br>
Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br>

        </p>

        <p>
            How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
            How public - like a Frog -<br>
            To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
            To an admiring Bog!
