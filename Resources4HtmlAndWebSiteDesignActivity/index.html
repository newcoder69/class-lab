            <p>Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state
               known for its rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August,
               making these two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children
               and others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.

               <p>So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
                  Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of
                  Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of
                  Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and
                  confidential poison and medication information to callers around the
                  clock.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
         from Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler.
         The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or
         bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.
               </p>
         
               <p>
                  "We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
         snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
         Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
         medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can
         make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams treating
         them."
               </p>
         
               <p>
                  The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes
         to be aware of these five things:
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
                     camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
                  <li>Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there
                     will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</li>
                  
                  <li>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
                     dangerous if they bite a human.</li>
                  
                  <li>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or
                     while they are biting.</li>
                  
                  <li>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified
                     small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale
                     rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has happened
                     until they notice their symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.</li>
               </ol>
